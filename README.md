Hi! I'm Eric. I'm a comedy writer (wrote the Varsity Show the last 2 years, Editor-in-Chief of Jester right now), so I'm taking this class mostly for fun, after I enjoyed 1004 so much last semester. I'm also taking Python later this spring.

Note: I have a Windows computer, so I've had a really hard time setting up for this assignment. I'm going to try to run Laptop on my friend's Mac for now, but I'd probably be better off installing a VM with Linux or something, right? 

Anyway, thanks for reading!
